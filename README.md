# sport_league

Website which shows the statistics of the team and the players in a particular league. The website is on Django framework.

Once Django is installed open the windows power shell and navigate to the main directory (i.e. sport_league) of the project through the power shell.
This main directory will contain the file manage.py.

In this directory type
	- python manage.py runserver

This starts the server in the default localhost address 127.0.0.1:8000
